## Tableau Workbook details 
This workbook contains analytic visuals on the Citi Bike program. These visualizations contain data from 2020, 2021, and 2022 to portray different visualizations in Ride Counts over time, popular ride times, popular ride stations, and analysis of ride counts when assessed with significant time periods of COVID19.

## Dynamic Map
This map shows all station locations with their respective zipcodes showing relative ride count over time. 

## Popular Stations & Ride Times
This dashboard shows the most popular stations to start and end at as well as the most popular ride times by each month. 
All popular ride stations are east of Manhattan, which occurs possibly due to commuters who ride CitiBikes from their residential homes to the subway station. 
Popular Ride times coincide with commute times 8AM and 5PM.

## Relating to COVID19
This dashboard shows the bike ride count statistics against times when COVID19 cases were relevant. 

April 2020 approximately marks when Stay at Home orders were the most strict and COVID19 Cases were newly on the rise. Although reported cases were lower, the death counts were relatively high. Ride counts were reported the lowest during this time. 

However, the second larger wave of reported cases happened during December 2020-January 2021. Death counts were the highest during this time and reported cases were significantly high compared to the first peak. Ride counts were still significantly lower during this time, but still higher than the first wave perhaps due to increasing COVID19 restriction fatigue. 

Finally, the largest wave in COVID19 cases occurred approximately in January 2022 with the new Omicron variant. Although reported cases were at the highest by a significant amount, ride counts still increased almost twofold. This could be due to multple factors such as high COVID19 restriction fatigue, increased rates in vaccinations, or decreased severity of symptoms in COVID19 positive individuals. 

Additionally, February and March of 2022 show a significant increase in ride counts, March ride counts being significantly higher than February. Although the increase in February could be accounted by the fact that COVID19 cases were on a sharp decline, the increase between February and March is most likely due to warmer weather and more daylight due to Daylight Savings occuring in March.
